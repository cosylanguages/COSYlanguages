# AGENTS.md — COSYlanguages repository

Persistent notes for agents working in this repo and the wider COSYlanguages org.

## What this repo is

`COSYlanguages` is the public gateway site of the COSYlanguages ecosystem: a set of
**static GitHub Pages sites with no build step and no backend**. Pages are plain
HTML/CSS/JS served directly from `main`. There is no bundler, no framework, and no
server runtime — treat every change as "edit files, push, Pages redeploys".

- Deployed at `https://cosylanguages.github.io/COSYlanguages/`.
- Shared runtime data lives in the sibling `COSYdata` repo and is fetched at
  runtime, e.g. `https://cosylanguages.github.io/COSYdata/comparative/*`.
- Runtime URLs are absolute `cosylanguages.github.io` paths, so cross-repo links
  break if a repo is renamed.

## Ecosystem map (13 repos under the `cosylanguages` account)

Core: `COSYlanguages` (gateway), `COSYplatform` (app: auth, classroom, studio),
`COSYdata` (datasets + generators), `COSYworld` (dialogue engine game),
`COSYtools` (reference tools), `COSYevents`, `COSYmanuals`, `COSYmagazine`,
`COSYpractice`, `COSYgames`, `COSYstudio`.

Watch-outs:
- `COSYlanguagesss` and `COSYplatform-source` are extra repos not part of the
  documented set. `COSYlanguagesss` is a large (≈450 MB) near-duplicate of the
  gateway with its own GitHub Pages site and overlapping content — prefer
  `COSYlanguages` as the source of truth.
- `COSYlanguages` is a shallow clone in some workspaces; run
  `git fetch --unshallow` (or `--deepen=N`) before history-dependent operations.

## Tests

This repo uses the Node built-in test runner. Word Explorer unit tests:

```bash
node --test tests/word-explorer.test.js
```

Other repos in the org have their own runners (`npm test` in `COSYplatform`,
`COSYtools`, `COSYmagazine`, `COSYdata`; `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` in
`COSYworld`/`COSYmanuals`). Supabase/RLS tests require the Supabase CLI + Docker
and only run in CI.

## Conventions

- Keep changes additive and minimal; do not delete existing functionality.
- `comparative/` holds the Comparative Atlas; Word Explorer is a tab wired in
  `comparative/index.html` (`word-explorer-*.js/css`, docs in `WORD_EXPLORER.md`).
- Shared assets live in `shared/`; i18n strings in `shared/i18n/*.json`.
