# COSYlanguages vs COSYdata Vocabulary Comparison Audit

## Executive Summary
This report presents a language-by-language, level-by-level, and word-level comparison between the vocabulary dataset currently residing in **COSYlanguages** (`vocabulary/`) and the central source-of-truth dataset in **COSYdata** (`https://github.com/cosylanguages/cosydata/tree/main/vocabulary/`).

### Primary Findings
1. **Repository Inventory**:
   - **COSYlanguages**: 1,198 total vocabulary files across **14 languages** (`ba`, `br`, `cv`, `de`, `el`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `hy`, `it`, `ka`, `pt`, `ru`, `tt`).
   - **COSYdata**: 407 total vocabulary files across **5 core languages** (`el`, `en`, `fr`, `it`, `ru`).
2. **Format Differences**:
   - **COSYlanguages**: Uses client-side JavaScript wrapped modules (`(function() { const data = [...]; window.vocabularyData = ...; })();`) in `.js` format (with occasional `.json` files). Folder structure uses uppercase level codes (`A1`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2`).
   - **COSYdata**: Uses standardized Draft-07 JSON files (`.json`) with unified schemas (`id`, `word`, `language`, `form`, `level`, `transcription`, `emoji`, `definitions`, `examples`, `domain`, `theme`). Folder structure uses lowercase level codes (`a0_a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `c1`, `c2`).
3. **Data Overlap & Unique Scope**:
   - **English (`en`)**: COSYdata is vastly larger (10,350 unique words across A0-C2 vs 2,194 unique words in COSYlanguages). 1,252 words overlap.
   - **French (`fr`), Italian (`it`), Russian (`ru`), Greek (`el`)**: COSYlanguages contains more unique word entries at higher levels (B1-C2) than COSYdata currently has populated (COSYdata currently covers A0-A1 and A2 for FR, IT, RU, and A0-A1 for EL).
   - **Other 9 Languages (`ba`, `br`, `cv`, `de`, `es`, `hy`, `ka`, `pt`, `tt`)**: Present **only** in COSYlanguages (0 files in COSYdata).

## Level Breakdown & Schema Differences

### 1. English (`en`)
- **COSYlanguages Levels**: `A1` (118 files), `A2` (128 files), `B1` (40 files), `B2` (21 files), `C1` (26 files), `C2` (16 files). Total unique words: **2,194**.
- **COSYdata Levels**: `a0_a1` (36 files), `a2` (42 files), `b1` (52 files), `b2` (44 files), `c1` (39 files), `c2` (23 files). Total unique words: **10,350**.
- **Analysis**: COSYdata contains a superset of English vocabulary for all CEFR levels.

### 2. French (`fr`), Italian (`it`), Russian (`ru`), Greek (`el`)
- **COSYlanguages**: Contains full A1-C2 coverage.
- **COSYdata**: Contains `a0_a1` and `a2` (FR, IT, RU) or `a0_a1` (EL).
- **Analysis**: Higher CEFR levels (B1, B2, C1, C2) for these languages must be retained in COSYlanguages until COSYdata completes intake for higher levels.

### 3. Minority & Additional Languages (`ba`, `br`, `cv`, `de`, `es`, `hy`, `ka`, `pt`, `tt`)
- **COSYlanguages**: Fully populated with A1-C2 datasets.
- **COSYdata**: 0 files.
- **Analysis**: All 9 languages must remain in COSYlanguages until they are migrated upstream into COSYdata.

## Action Plan & Architecture Impact

1. **Deletion Safety Rule**: Do NOT delete local JS files from `vocabulary/` for a language/level until a remote loader fetch or build script exists to supply practice engines (`practice/`, `js/games/utils/shared.js`, `scripts/verify_vocab_pool.js`) with equivalent or superior data from COSYdata.
2. **Dynamic Adapter Strategy**:
   - Implement an adapter layer in `js/core/engine.js` / `practice/types/vocabulary/vocabulary.js` that fetches JSON files directly from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosylanguages/cosydata/main/vocabulary/` when requested.
   - For levels missing in COSYdata, fall back to local `vocabulary/{lang}/{LEVEL}/` JS files seamlessly.
3. **Phased Unit Deletion**:
   - Once the remote fetch adapter is active and passing CI (`node scripts/verify_vocab_pool.js`), delete local duplicate JS files for `en` (A1-C2) and `a0_a1`/`a2` for `fr`, `it`, `ru`, `el`.
