RESOLVED [2026-09-12]: apps/premium-courses/ and entitlements.js were removed once COSYplatform's dual-view app went live. Kept here for history.

# Paid Content & Repo Boundary Audit

## Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive inventory and audit of paid/course content, entitlements/passcode infrastructure, undocumented top-level directories, and root temporary files in `COSYlanguages`.

Per the architecture direction, `COSYlanguages` is the **100% FREE, public entry point** to the COSY ecosystem. Paid courses, conversational events, and gated portals belong in sibling repositories (`COSYplatform` / `COSYmanuals` / `COSYevents`). None of the paid course or passcode code is deleted in this task; this audit records their location and state for future migration.

## 2. Top-Level Directory Audit & Recommendations

1. **`reference-grammar/`**: Machine-readable JSON grammar reference datasets (morphology, syntax, phonology, particles) across 13 languages.
   - *Recommendation:* Move to `COSYmanuals` (restricted curriculum/textbook repo) or retain as shared engine data.
2. **`wordlists/`**: Unstructured text wordlist files under `wordlists/genera course/`.
   - *Recommendation:* Move to `COSYmanuals` or delete as superseded by structured `vocabulary/` datasets.
3. **`comparative/`**: 14-language comparative grammar atlas matrix HTML page (`comparative/index.html`) and datasets (`comparative/data/`).
   - *Recommendation:* Keep here in `COSYlanguages` as a free public reference tool.
4. **`hybrid/`**: "Beyond the Screen" hybrid section (`index.html`, `bridge.html`, `zine.html`, `radio.html`) with client-side QR generator and offline study materials.
   - *Recommendation:* Keep here in `COSYlanguages` as free hybrid learning resources.
5. **`communication/`**: Functional communication authoring standards and JSON schemas (`COMMUNICATION_STANDARD.md`, `_schema/`).
   - *Recommendation:* Move to `COSYmanuals` alongside curriculum datasets.
6. **`blog/`**: Free public SEO articles and Top 100 A0-A1 vocabulary pages across 13 target languages.
   - *Recommendation:* Keep here in `COSYlanguages` as free public content.
7. **`about/`**: Public platform overview and methodology landing page (`about/index.html`).
   - *Recommendation:* Keep here in `COSYlanguages`.
